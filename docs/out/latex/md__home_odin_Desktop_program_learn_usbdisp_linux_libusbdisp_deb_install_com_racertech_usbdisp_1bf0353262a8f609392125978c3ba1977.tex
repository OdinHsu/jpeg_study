The Extensible Virtual Display Interface (EVDI) is a Linux\textregistered{} kernel module that enables management of multiple screens, allowing user-\/space programs to take control over what happens with the image. It is essentially a virtual display you can add, remove and receive screen updates for, in an application that uses the {\ttfamily libevdi} library.

The project is part of the Display\+Link Ubuntu development which enables support for Display\+Link USB 3.\+0 devices on Ubuntu. Please note that {\bfseries{this is NOT a complete driver for Display\+Link devices}}. For more information and the full driver package, see \href{http://www.displaylink.com/downloads/ubuntu.php}{\texttt{ Display\+Link Ubuntu driver}}.

This open-\/source project includes source code for both the {\ttfamily evdi} kernel module and a wrapper {\ttfamily libevdi} library that can be used by applications like Display\+Link\textquotesingle{}s user mode driver to send and receive information from and to the kernel module.\hypertarget{md__home_odin_Desktop_program_learn_usbdisp_linux_libusbdisp_deb_install_com_racertech_usbdisp_1bf0353262a8f609392125978c3ba1977_autotoc_md61}{}\doxysection{How to use}\label{md__home_odin_Desktop_program_learn_usbdisp_linux_libusbdisp_deb_install_com_racertech_usbdisp_1bf0353262a8f609392125978c3ba1977_autotoc_md61}
See \href{https://displaylink.github.io/evdi}{\texttt{ libevdi API documentation}} for details.

EVDI is a driver compatible with a standard Linux DRM subsystem. Due to this, displays can be controlled by standard tools, eg. {\ttfamily xrandr} or display settings applets in graphical environments eg. Unity, Gnome or KDE.

Minimum supported kernel version required is 4.\+15. Display\+Link have checked the module compiles and works with Ubuntu variants of kernels up to 5.\+5. Although other vanilla Linux kernel sources are used for Travis CI job, newer kernels, or kernel variants used by other distributions may require extra development. Please see below to see how you can help.\hypertarget{md__home_odin_Desktop_program_learn_usbdisp_linux_libusbdisp_deb_install_com_racertech_usbdisp_1bf0353262a8f609392125978c3ba1977_autotoc_md62}{}\doxysection{Future Development}\label{md__home_odin_Desktop_program_learn_usbdisp_linux_libusbdisp_deb_install_com_racertech_usbdisp_1bf0353262a8f609392125978c3ba1977_autotoc_md62}
This is a first release. Display\+Link are open to suggestions and feedback on improving the proposed architecture and will gladly review patches or proposals from the developer community. Please find a current list of areas we identify as requiring attention below.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Compatibility with distributions other than Ubuntu 18.\+04/20.04 LTS is not verified. Please let us know if you make it work on other distros -\/ pull requests are welcome!
\item The communication between the EVDI kernel module and the wrapper libevdi library is not access-\/controlled or authenticated. This could be improved in future releases, making it harder to compromise the data EVDI is sending and receiving.
\item EVDI kernel module driver is currently a platform\+\_\+driver, for multiple reasons; most importantly because virtual displays are not discoverable, i.\+e. cannot be enumerated at the hardware level. EVDI is also a generic device, not tied to any particular kind of device, transport layer or a bus.
